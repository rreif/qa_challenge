# Raylytic QA challenge

As requested in order to complete the challenge I split my solution in two different technical approaches.

Data setup interactions are done via karate, the according project is nested under `raylytic_test_project`.
The acceptance test part is done with Cypress, the according folder is `raylytic_acceptance`.

Since I don't have hands-on experience with both technologies, I hope that it does not only run on my machine ðŸ˜„
